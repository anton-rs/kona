## What's Kona?

Kona is a suite of portable implementations of the OP Stack rollup state transition, namely the [derivation pipeline][g-derivation-pipeline] and
the block execution logic.

Built on top of these libraries, this repository also features a [fault proof program][fpp-specs] designed to deterministically execute the
rollup state transition in order to verify an [L2 output root][g-output-root] from the L1 inputs it was [derived from][g-derivation-pipeline].

### Alternative Backends

Kona's libraries were built with alternative backend support and extensibility in mind - it is not just a fault proof
program! Kona is also used by:

- [`op-succinct`][op-succinct]
- [`kailua`][kailua]

To build your own backend for kona, or build a new application on top of its libraries,
see the [SDK section of the book](https://op-rs.github.io/kona/sdk/intro.html).

### Development Status

`kona` is currently in active development, and is not yet ready for use in production.

## Overview

**`kona`**

- [`client`](./bin/client): The bare-metal program that runs on top of a [fault proof VM][g-fault-proof-vm].
- [`host`](./bin/host): The host program that runs natively alongside the FPVM, serving as the [Preimage Oracle][g-preimage-oracle] server.

**Protocol**
- [`mpt`](./crates/mpt): Utilities for interacting with the Merkle Patricia Trie in the client program.
- [`executor`](./crates/executor): `no_std` stateless block executor for the [OP Stack][op-stack].
- [`derive`](./crates/derive): `no_std` compatible implementation of the [derivation pipeline][g-derivation-pipeline].
  - [`driver`](./crates/driver): Stateful derivation pipeline driver.
- [`interop`](./crates/interop): Core functionality and primitives for the [Interop feature](https://specs.optimism.io/interop/overview.html) of the OP Stack.

**Proof SDK**

- [`kona-proof`](./crates/proof-sdk/proof): High level OP Stack state transition proof SDK.
- [`kona-proof-interop`](./crates/proof-sdk/proof-interop): Extension of `kona-proof` with interop support.
- [`preimage`](./crates/proof-sdk/preimage): High level interfaces to the [`PreimageOracle`][fpp-specs] ABI.
- [`std-fpvm`](./crates/proof-sdk/std-fpvm): Platform specific [Fault Proof VM][g-fault-proof-vm] kernel APIs.
- [`std-fpvm-proc`](./crates/proof-sdk/std-fpvm-proc): Proc macro for [Fault Proof Program][fpp-specs] entrypoints.

## Book

The [book][book] contains a more in-depth overview of the project, contributor guidelines, tutorials for
getting started with building your own programs, and a reference for the libraries and tools provided by Kona.

## Credits

`kona` is inspired by the work of several teams, namely [OP Labs][op-labs] and other contributors' work on the
[`op-program`][op-program] and [BadBoiLabs][bad-boi-labs]'s work on [Cannon-rs][badboi-cannon-rs].

`kona` is also built on rust types in [alloy][alloy], [op-alloy][op-alloy], and [maili][maili].
