## What's Kona?

Kona is a suite of portable implementations of the OP Stack rollup state transition, namely the [derivation pipeline][g-derivation-pipeline] and
the block execution logic.

Built on top of these libraries, this repository also features a [fault proof program][fpp-specs] designed to deterministically execute the
rollup state transition in order to verify an [L2 output root][g-output-root] from the L1 inputs it was [derived from][g-derivation-pipeline].

### Development Status

`kona` is currently in active development, and is not yet ready for use in production.

## Overview

**`kona`**

- [`client`](./bin/programs/client): The bare-metal program that runs on top of a [fault proof VM][g-fault-proof-vm].
- [`host`](./bin/host): The host program that runs natively alongside the FPVM, serving as the [Preimage Oracle][g-preimage-oracle] server.

**Build Pipelines**

- [`cannon`](./build/cannon): Docker image for compiling to the bare-metal `mips-unknown-none` target.
- [`asterisc`](./build/asterisc): Docker image for compiling to the bare-metal `riscv64gc-unknown-none-elf` target.

**`client` / `host` SDK**

- [`common`](./crates/common): A suite of utilities for developing `client` programs to be ran on top of Fault Proof VMs.
- [`common-proc`](./crates/common-proc): Proc macro for the `client` program entrypoint.
- [`primitives`](./crates/primitives): Primitive types for use in `kona` crates.
- [`preimage`](./crates/preimage): High level interfaces to the [`PreimageOracle`][fpp-specs] ABI
- [`mpt`](./crates/mpt): Utilities for interacting with the Merkle Patricia Trie in the client program.
- [`executor`](./crates/executor): `no_std` stateless block executor for the [OP Stack][op-stack].
- [`derive`](./crates/derive): `no_std` compatible implementation of the [derivation pipeline][g-derivation-pipeline].
  - [`plasma`](./crates/plasma/): Plasma extension to `kona-derive`

## Book

The [book][book] contains a more in-depth overview of the project, contributor guidelines, tutorials for getting started with building your own programs, and a reference for the libraries and tools provided by Kona.

## Credits

`kona` is inspired by the work of several teams, namely [OP Labs][op-labs] and other contributors' work on the [`op-program`][op-program] and [BadBoiLabs][bad-boi-labs]'s work on [Cannon-rs][badboi-cannon-rs].
