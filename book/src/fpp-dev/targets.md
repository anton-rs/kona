| ---- | ----------- | --------------- | ---------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 4090 | mmap        | uint32 addr     | uint32 len | üö´           | Allocates a page from the heap. See [heap](#heap) for details.                                                       |
| 4045 | brk         | üö´              | üö´         | üö´           | Returns a fixed address for the program break at `0x40000000`                                                        |
| 4120 | clone       | üö´              | üö´         | üö´           | Returns 1                                                                                                            |
| 4246 | exit_group  | uint8 exit_code | üö´         | üö´           | Sets the Exited and ExitCode states to `true` and `$a0` respectively.                                                |
| 4003 | read        | uint32 fd       | char \*buf | uint32 count | Similar behavior as Linux/MIPS with support for unaligned reads. See [I/O](#io) for more details.                    |
| 4004 | write       | uint32 fd       | char \*buf | uint32 count | Similar behavior as Linux/MIPS with support for unaligned writes. See [I/O](#io) for more details.                   |
| 4055 | fcntl       | uint32 fd       | int32 cmd  | üö´           | Similar behavior as Linux/MIPS. Only the `F_GETFL` (3) cmd is supported. Sets errno to `0x16` for all other commands |

For all of the above syscalls, an error is indicated by setting the return
register (`$v0`) to `0xFFFFFFFF` (-1) and `errno` (`$a3`) is set accordingly.
The VM must not modify any register other than `$v0` and `$a3` during syscall handling.
For unsupported syscalls, the VM must do nothing except to zero out the syscall return (`$v0`)
and errno (`$a3`) registers.

Note that the above syscalls have identical syscall numbers and ABIs as Linux/MIPS.

## Asterisc (RISC-V)

Asterisc is based off of the `rv64gc` target architecture, which defines the following extensions:

- `RV32I` support - 32 bit base instruction set
  - `FENCE`, `ECALL`, `EBREAK` are hardwired to implement a minimal subset of systemcalls of the linux kernel
    - Work in progress. All syscalls used by the Golang `risc64` runtime.
- `RV64I` support
- `RV64C`: Compressed instructions
- `RV32M`+`RV64M`: Multiplication support
- `RV32A`+`RV64A`: Atomics support
- `RV{32,64}{D,F,Q}`: no-op: No floating points support (since no IEEE754 determinism with rounding modes etc., nor worth the complexity)
- `Zifencei`: `FENCE.I` no-op: No need for `FENCE.I`
- `Zicsr`: no-op: some support for Control-and-status registers may come later though.
- `Ztso`: no-op: no need for Total Store Ordering
- other: revert with error code on unrecognized instructions

`asterisc` supports a plethora of syscalls, documented [in the repository][asterisc-syscalls]. `kona` offers an interface for
programs to directly invoke a select few syscalls:

1. `EXIT` - Terminate the process with the provided exit code.
1. `WRITE` - Write the passed buffer to the passed file descriptor.
1. `READ` - Read the specified number of bytes from the passed file descriptor.
