# Kona SDK

Welcome to the Kona SDK, a powerful set of libraries designed to revolutionize the way developers build proofs for the
OP Stack STF on top of the OP Stack's FPVMs and other verifiable backends like [SP-1][sp-1], [Risc0][rzero], 
[Intel TDX][tdx], and [AMD SEV-SNP][sev-snp]. At its core, Kona is built on the principles of modularity, extensibility,
and developer empowerment.

## A Foundation of Flexibility

The kona repository is more than a fault proof program for the OP Stack — it's an ecosystem of interoperable components,
each crafted with reusability and extensibility as primary goals. While we provide a robust 
{{#template ../../templates/glossary-link.md root=./ ref=fault-proof-vm text=Fault Proof VM}} and a "online" backend
for key components like `kona-derive` and `kona-executor`, the true power of `kona` lies in its adaptability.

## Extend Without Forking

One of Kona's standout features is its ability to support custom features and data sources without requiring you to fork
the entire project. Through careful use of Rust's powerful trait system and abstract interfaces, we've created a 
framework that allows you to plug in your own features and ideas seamlessly. 

## What You'll Learn

In this section of the developer book, we'll dive deep into the Kona SDK, covering:
* **Building on the FPVM Backend**: Learn how to leverage the Fault Proof VM tooling to create your own fault proof programs.
* **Creating Custom Backends**: Discover the process of designing and implementing your own backend to run `kona-client` or a variation of it on different targets.
* **Extending Core Components**: Explore techniques for creating new constructs that integrate smoothly with crates like `kona-derive` and `kona-executor`.

Whether you're looking to use Kona as-is, extend its functionality, or create entirely new programs based on its libraries,
this guide is intended to provide you with the knowledge and tools you need to succeed.
