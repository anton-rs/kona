# Custom Backends

## Understanding the OP Stack STF

The OP Stack state transition is comprised of two primary components:

- **The [derivation pipeline](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/derivation.html)** (`kona-derive`)
  - Responsible for deriving L2 chain state from the DA layer.
- **The [execution engine](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/exec-engine.html#l2-execution-engine)** (`kona-executor`)
  - Responsible for the execution of transactions and state commitments.
  - Ensures correct application of derived L2 state.

To prove the correctness of the state transition, Kona composes these two components:

- It combines the derivation of the L2 chain with its execution in the same process.
- It pulls in necessary data from sources to complete the STF, verifiably unrolling the input commitments along the way.

`kona-client` serves as an implementation of this process, capable of deriving and executing a single L2 block in a
verifiable manner.

> 📖 Why just a single block by default?
>
> On the OP Stack, we employ an interactive bisection game that narrows in on the disagreed upon block -> block state
> transition before requiring a fault proof to be ran. Because of this, the default implementation only serves
> to derive and execute the single block that the participants of the bisection game landed on.

## Backend Traits

Covered in the [FPVM Backend](./fpvm-backend.md) section of the book, `kona-client` ships with an implementation of
`kona-derive` and `kona-executor`'s data source traits which pull in data over the [PreimageOracle ABI][preimage-specs].

However, running `kona-client` on top of a different verifiable environment, i.e. a zkVM or TEE, is also possible
through custom implementations of these data source traits.

[`op-succinct`](https://github.com/succinctlabs/op-succinct) is an excellent example of both a custom backend and a custom
program, implementing both `kona-derive` and `kona-executor`'s data source traits backed by [sp1_lib::io](https://docs.rs/sp1-lib/latest/sp1_lib/io/index.html)
in order to:

1. Execute `kona-client` verbatim, proving a single block's derivation and execution on SP-1.
1. Derive and execute an entire [Span Batch](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/delta/span-batches.html#span-batches)
   worth of L2 blocks, using `kona-derive` and `kona-executor`.

This section of the book outlines how you can do the same.

### Custom `kona-derive` sources

Before getting started, we need to create custom implementations of the following traits:

| Trait                                                                                                 | Description                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`ChainProvider`](https://docs.rs/kona-derive/latest/kona_derive/traits/trait.ChainProvider.html)     | The `ChainProvider` trait describes the minimal interface for fetching data from L1 during L2 chain derivation.                     |
| [`L2ChainProvider`](https://docs.rs/kona-derive/latest/kona_derive/traits/trait.L2ChainProvider.html) | The `ChainProvider` trait describes the minimal interface for fetching data from the safe L2 chain during L2 chain derivation.      |
| [`BlobProvider`](https://docs.rs/kona-derive/latest/kona_derive/traits/trait.BlobProvider.html)       | The `BlobProvider` trait describes an interface for fetching EIP-4844 blobs from the L1 consensus layer during L2 chain derivation. |

Once these are implemented, constructing the pipeline is as simple as passing in the data sources to the `PipelineBuilder`.

```rs
let chain_provider = ...;
let l2_chain_provider = ...;
let blob_provider = ...;
let l1_origin = ...;

let cfg = Arc::new(RollupConfig::default());
let attributes = StatefulAttributesBuilder::new(
   cfg.clone(),
   l2_chain_provider.clone(),
   chain_provider.clone(),
);
let dap = EthereumDataSource::new(
   chain_provider.clone(),
   blob_provider,
   cfg.as_ref()
);

// Construct a new derivation pipeline.
let pipeline = PipelineBuilder::new()
   .rollup_config(cfg)
   .dap_source(dap)
   .l2_chain_provider(l2_chain_provider)
   .chain_provider(chain_provider)
   .builder(attributes)
   .origin(l1_origin)
   .build();
```

From here, a custom derivation driver is needed to produce the desired execution payload(s). An example of this for
`kona-client` can be found in the [DerivationDriver](https://github.com/anton-rs/kona/blob/main/bin/client/src/l1/driver.rs#L77).

### `kona-mpt` / `kona-executor` sources

Before getting started, we need to create custom implementations of the following traits:

| Trait                                                                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`TrieDBFetcher`](https://docs.rs/kona-mpt/latest/kona_mpt/trait.TrieDBFetcher.html) | The `TrieDBFetcher` trait describes the interface for fetching trie node preimages and chain information while executing a payload on the L2 chain.                                                                                                                                                                                |
| [`TrieDBHinter`](https://docs.rs/kona-mpt/latest/kona_mpt/trait.TrieDBHinter.html)   | The `TrieDBHinter` trait describes the interface for requesting the host program to prepare trie proof preimages for the client's consumption. For targets with upfront witness generation, i.e. zkVMs, a no-op hinter is exported as [`NoopTrieDBHinter`](https://docs.rs/kona-mpt/latest/kona_mpt/struct.NoopTrieDBHinter.html). |

Once we have those, the `StatelessL2BlockExecutor` can be constructed like so:

```rust
let cfg = RollupConfig::default();
let provider = ...;
let hinter = ...;

let executor = StatelessL2BlcokExecutor::builder(&cfg, provider, hinter)
   .with_parent_header(...)
   .build();

let header = executor.execute_payload(...).expect("Failed execution");
```

### Bringing it Together

Once your custom backend traits for both `kona-derive` and `kona-executor` have been implemented,
your final binary may look something like [that of `kona-client`'s](https://github.com/anton-rs/kona/blob/main/bin/client/src/kona.rs).
Alternatively, if you're looking to prove a wider range of blocks, [`op-succinct`'s `range` program](https://github.com/succinctlabs/op-succinct/tree/main/programs/range)
offers a good example of running the pipeline and executor across a string of contiguous blocks.
