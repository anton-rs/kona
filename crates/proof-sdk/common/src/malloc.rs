//! This module contains an implementation of a basic memory allocator for client programs in
//! running on an embedded device.

//! The allocator is a linked list allocator based on the `dlmalloc` algorithm, which is a
//! well-known and widely used allocator software such as OS Kernels.

/// The global allocator for the program in embedded environments.
