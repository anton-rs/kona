/// of the kernel.
///
/// Commonly, embedded proving environments delegate IO operations to custom file descriptors.
/// This trait is a safe wrapper around the raw system calls available to the `client` program
/// for host<->client communication.
///
/// In cases where the set of system calls defined in this trait need to be extended, an additional
/// trait should be created that extends this trait.

    fn read(fd: FileDescriptor, buf: &mut [u8]) -> IOResult<usize>;

    /// should always panic after invoking the `EXIT` syscall.
